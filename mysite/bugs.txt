27/1: When trying to register a user, it redirects to register/blog/register instead of blog/register. Have looked into this and tested different things and found one sort-of-fix (setting up a new url to go to the appropriate view) but this comes with more issues (any further navigation adds the /register/ prefix so it would be necessary to make new urls for every existing url)
27/1: The registration process appears to work (when circumventing the issue mentioned previously) but no new user is actually created. 

28/1: Registration process now works and creates users, but the redirect problem persists. 

3/2: I've started from scratch following the Django By Example videos. I've setup the basic blog and comments functions, but the comments form is not rendering despite my code seemingly being identical to the tutorial content.


8/2: Resolved
